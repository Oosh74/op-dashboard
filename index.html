              <p class="house-description">
                Noble and just, House Atreides is renowned for its honor,
                military acumen, and the loyalty it inspires in subjects and
                soldiers alike. Though once lords of the oceanic world of
                Caladan, the Atreides were granted stewardship of Arrakis—the
                sole source of spice melange—marking a pivotal shift in their
                political influence. Duke Leto Atreides is known for his
                fairness and integrity, though such virtues are perilous in the
                Imperium\'s shadowed game.

              <p class="house-description">
                Ruthless and cunning, House Harkonnen thrives on fear and
                domination. Their rule over Arrakis prior to House Atreides was
                marked by brutal exploitation and a singular focus on profit.
                Baron Vladimir Harkonnen\'s influence stretches far beyond his
                corpulent frame, and his house remains a symbol of raw ambition
                and moral corruption in the eyes of many.

                Once one of the most technologically advanced houses in the

                exile. Though technically restored, the house now operates under
                heavy scrutiny and influence from the Tleilaxu and CHOAM. Ixian
                technology remains coveted, and their innovations often skirt
                the edge of the anti-AI proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad.
